							<h3></h3>
							<p> Education </p>
						</header>
						<p> When I was around 6 years old I had my first piece of technology. An old Gateway desktop running Windows 95. 
							Technology always fasinated me and that curiousty hasnt left me. 
							In early highschool I started messing around using Cain and Abel and Wirshark (hacking tools). 
							To crack passwords, spoof networks and showoff to my friends. 
							Right out of highschool I didnt know what I wanted to do with my life so I went and got my associateds degree in Liberal Arts. 
							I took a year off of school before deciding to pursue an education in Computer Science. 
							I went and got my B.S. in Computer Science from SUNY Empire. Took another year of from school before getting the urge to go back.
							This time I went for Information Security. Norwich Universetiy taught me so much in such a short time. 
							I understand that there is two parts to security, management and physical/software side.
							Before I thought it was install install "xyz" to stop "x" attack. It is so much more. 
							Businesses need to have polcies, protocals, audits, patching plans, diaster recovery, awareness training, to name a few topics.
							I'm currently out of school, but that hasn't stopped me from learning. I'm working on this website and programming Python projects. 
							I plan on in the near future going to a coding bootcamp, for machine learning. 
							</p>

							<h3></h3>
							<p> Career </p>
						</header>
						<p> Out of highschool I have been working on and off as a general contractor. 
							I have learned many valuable skills that I have applied to my own home. 
							After my contracting job I got my foot in the door at a local Hospital doing laundry. 
							After my 6-month probation was up I switched departments into Health Information Management. 
							There I managed records for an entire nursing home, along with two other wings of the hospital.
							It wasnt long before I was promoted to Correspondence Technician. 
							This put me in charge of handling the release of records to lawyers and patients. 
							I ended up leaving the hospital to work for a private doctors office. 
							Doing similar work that I had been doing at the hospital, plus IT support for the office.
							I worked there for almost 5 years. Wearing many different hats along the way.
							I worked frontdesk, IT, and was a project manager to name a few. I felt that I had hit my ceiling there at the office. 
							I left on good terms to pursue new oppurtunities. During the last year I have went back to contracting on and off. 
							I also have been travelling the North East and contining to learn. All while searching for the right job.
